"""Bank every daily settlement Massive serves, so the app's history stops expiring.

Massive's own window starts 2021-09 and only covers contracts it still carries; corn and
soybeans reach 2008 through a one-off workbook ETL (history_archive.py), but wheat, meal
and oil have nothing older. CME DataMine's end-of-day futures files would fill the gap and
the file codes are real, but JSA's licence doesn't cover them (403 "not entitled"), so the
gap can't be closed today.

What can be done is stop losing ground: snapshot every settlement Massive shows into
Snowflake (JSA.COST_OF_CARRY.FUTURES_SETTLEMENTS) each day. The archive then deepens on
its own — a year from now wheat has six crop years instead of five, held by JSA rather
than rented from a vendor's rolling window.

    python scripts/refresh_settlements.py              # yesterday forward, all markets
    python scripts/refresh_settlements.py --backfill   # everything Massive still serves

Rows are keyed on (ticker, date) and MERGEd, so re-runs and overlapping windows are safe.
